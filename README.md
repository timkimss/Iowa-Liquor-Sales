Final Project for Statistical Modeling
 
Co-authors: Jun Seok Choi and Adam Solar

Census Tract Data was taken from: http://census.ire.org/data/bulkdata.html

Iowa Liquor Sales Data was from: https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/data

We used Census Tract Data from 2010 and Liquor Sales Data from 2018.

Data Cleaning and Wrangling, and Analysis done in R.

In the last decade, college students have been drinking increasingly more hard liquor and consequently have been further at risk of the 
many dangers that hard drinking entails. We created a regression model using sales data and census track data to model weekly volume of
hard alcohol sold in all Iowa liquor stores. In addition, conducted an extra sum of squares test in order to determine whether we can see
the effects of having a college nearby, as well as the academic characteristics of that college improved our model. While the statistical
test provided evidence that variables related to local colleges and universities improved our regression model, the model itself may not 
have much practical significance.
